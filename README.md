This provides some Prolog code used to search for alternative coefficient for Strassen like Matrix Multiplications.

As of now, it searches for coefficient when restricting ourselves to 4 multiplications between the fours N/2 quadrants, but I have been able to demonstrate there is not solution to this problem. Next step is to try with either 5 multiplications, or try breaking the matrix into 6 or 9 blocks.
